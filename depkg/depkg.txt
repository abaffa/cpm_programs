depkg.com - Extract files from a Package created using Grant Searle's "Binary to CPM Package"

Why is this useful?

Although we can use xmodem to transfer a single file to our CPM machine, it is
a time consuming task to transfer software collections with large numbers of files.

Step 1: Using the "Binary to CPM Package" utility, we can combine many files to a single file
called a package.  

Step 2: We use xmodem to transfer the package into CPM.

Step 3: We use depkg.com to extract the original files.

Example:  depkg infocom.pkg

Speed Tests:
Using the RC2014, I depkg'd infocom.pkg which is 481,423 bytes.
