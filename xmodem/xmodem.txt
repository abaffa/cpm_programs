xmodem.txt   This file, You're reading it!
xmodem.com   CPM80 executable v2.7 patched to use CON: as transfer device & /Z5
xmodem.cfg   Useful to see what CLI options are available but not really needed (I do not use this file)
xmodem.hex   Ready to paste into your Boot Monitor (see below)
xmodem.pkg   RC2014 "download" ready to put xmodem.com on your machine

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is XMODEM?  How was this changed for the RC2014?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A program that allows you to transfer binary files (.com) to & from your PC.
This implementation of xmode was created by M. Eberhard.

A small change was made to the official release to use the CON: as the default device
for transfers. This means /X0 is the default settings (instead of /X2)

Another RC2014 change was to make /Z5 the default CPM speed.  This affects the startup
speed when you perform a transfer.  Old default was /Z4 but many users noted that it
took +30secs for the transfer to start.

xmodem.com is the only file needed on your RC2014 using the stock full monty kit.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use it:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For me, using the normal 'download' method, I put xmodem.com on the C> drive of the RC2014

Example to upload a file from the PC to the RC2014...
Let's say you want to upload zork1.com to the G: drive...

A> G:                       # change to the G drive
G> c:xmodem zork1.com /r    # puts xmodem in receive mode using the console

now using the terminal emulator, start an xmodem send session.
After a few seconds, xmodem will start.  Uploads are very fast, taking only seconds for large files.

RC2014: How to load on a newly formatted CF Card
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: power on the RC2014 and hit space bar
Step 2: Paste XMODEM.HEX (a relocated XMODEM.HEX) to terminal window. 
        This will load xmodem.com into high memory. This normally 
        resides at 0100, but as the ROM is active, this area is not available.
Step 3: Type GFFE8 and press ENTER (this will relocate RAM 4100-->0100 and restart CP/M)
Step 4: When in CP/M, SAVE 17 XMODEM.COM
